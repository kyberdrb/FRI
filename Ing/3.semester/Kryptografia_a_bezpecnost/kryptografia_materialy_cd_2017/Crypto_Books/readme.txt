correct this issue:

when viewed with Adobe Acrobat 4.0 at this time.  For optimum quality please

The complexity of these books required us to do a text over graphics scan in 
order to ensure accuracy.  As a result the books look identical to the 
original from which they were scanned.  It may be of use to each individual 
user to adjust the window view which can be accessed from the shortcut bar 
or View Menu to find your personal preference .
